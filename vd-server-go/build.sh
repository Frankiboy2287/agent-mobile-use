# Seam tests first. They cover the header line the Java tool writes and the JSON
# envelope this daemon builds around it — the one contract with no type system across
# languages, which has already produced two silent defects: a failure body (a single
# line, no rows) read as unparseable output, and a failure message double-quoted into
# `error="\"...\""` once %q re-quoted it.
